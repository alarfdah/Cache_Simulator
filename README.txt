How were references use:
  1. I mostly only did one line commands with gcc so I wanted to learn a more
  complicated/advanced way of writing a makefile.

  2. I used a linked list implementation of a queue, but changed the
  implementation by switching where things got added and where they go removed
  from. Originally enqueuing added to the rear and dequeuing removed from the
  front, but I switched that. I needed to use a linked list implementation
  because it is much easier to remove items from the middle without out taking
  too much time.
